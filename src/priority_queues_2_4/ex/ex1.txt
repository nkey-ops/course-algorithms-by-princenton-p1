Suppose that the sequence

    P R I O * R * * I * T * Y * * * Q U E * * * U * E

(where a letter means insert and an asterisk means remove the maximum) 
is applied to an initially empty priority queue. 
Give the sequence of values returned by remove the maximum operations. 


P R I O       
            R 
P I O R       
            R       
            p
I O I       
            O
I I T    
            T        
I I Y 
            Y
