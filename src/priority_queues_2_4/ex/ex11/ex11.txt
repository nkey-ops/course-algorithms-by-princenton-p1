Suppose that your application will have a huge number of insert operations, 
but only a few remove the maximum operations. 
Which priority-queue implementation do you think would be most effective: 
heap, unordered array, ordered array? 

Solution:
Unordered array 
    insert operation is constant O(1)
    remove is quadratic O(N^2)
