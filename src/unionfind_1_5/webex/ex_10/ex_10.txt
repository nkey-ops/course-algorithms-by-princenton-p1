Hex. 
The game of Hex is played on a trapezoidal grid of hexagons.... 
Describe how to detect when white or black has won the game.
Use the union-find data structure. 

To win a game of Hex a player should connect two opposite sides of a trapezoidal grid
with the player's hexagons.

1. Before the start of the game, each side can be united as a separate component
where each hexagon of the side points to a component identifier that will represent this side.
It means for one player there will be two sites that represent two opposite sides 
with their component identifiers.

2. After each placement of a hexagon all the adjacent hexagons (up to 6) if not empty will be 
"united" with a newly placed one. 
  a. If a newly placed hexagon is adjacent to the side or to the other hexagon
     that is adjacent to the side, a new hexagon will be linked to the component identifier
     of the side and not vice versa (to prevent destruction of a side component identifier
     via swaps).
  b. If both a newly placed hexagon and adjacent one have component identifiers of two opposite
  sides (if the player "owns" them) arbitrarily link their component identifiers.
  This union operation will lead to the victory of the player

3. After each union two side component identifiers will be compared on equality 
(whether they share the same value)
  If they're equal last player that made a union operation won. 
Note: this operation takes O(1) because they (sites) are component identifiers.
